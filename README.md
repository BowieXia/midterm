# Midterm: Story Map

## Project Outline

For your midterm project, you will create a story map application for a dataset
of your choosing. A story map tells a story through several slides, each slide
combining text and data. The user is able to move forward and backwards through
the slides by clicking on next and previous buttons.

## Requirements

- Your story map should have at least five slides
- Your story map should have next and previous buttons
- On the first slide of your story map, the previous button should be hidden
- On the last slide of your story map, the next button should be hidden
- The application should be structured in a way where clicking on the next and
previous buttons will replace the data on the map and the text in the sidebar
with the next or previous content (in other words, you are not building five
different maps with different text and data—you are building one map in which
the content changes based on user input)
- At least one slide should change the zoom level or center of the map; see
fitBounds, setView, setZoom, and [related functions](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-set-methods)

## Getting Started

The midterm should be a new repository that you create on your personal github
account. Create a new repository on GitHub.com and then clone it to your local
machine using GitHub Desktop.

## Demo

These screenshots demonstate the functionality of the application. You do not
need to use this exact layout or style—feel free to make it look however you
want, as long as the functionality is the same.
